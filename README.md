# d_d_characterSheets_5e
Creates printable 5th edition D&amp;D character sheets as HTML from JSON.

The intent is to enter the minimum required amount of information in the JSON and let the system calculate the rest of the informration.  For example, you only enter the values for str, dex, etc. and the system calculates the modifiers.  Likewise you only enter your EXP and it calculates your level and all associated abilities.  Really the only things you should enter and the values that the player chooses
